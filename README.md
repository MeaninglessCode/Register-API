## Register API
This repo contains three sub-directories containing various components of a web-based PostgreSQL API meant to serve as a backing DB to a cash register application for an Android phone. The components can be described as follows:

* `AndroidClient/RegisterClient/` contains all Kotlin code used in running the cash register application via an Android phone.
* `DB_SQL` contains definitions for the 3 tables utilized in the PostgreSQL database.
* `WebAPI` contains all TypeScript files relating to servicing and handling requests through the API to affect the backing PostgreSQL database.

Everything in this project was completed as part of a 6-member team for my Software Engineering class. The format of this project was to be done in using a scrum methodology. Additionally, I reuploaded this project later on because I had left some personal information within the respostiory. This project was originally developed and created the Spring of 2018.
